           <pre>defines a preformatted text, used to display texts inside it in a fixed-width font and it preserves both space and line breaks and it is best used in the case of poerms instead of the default paragraph tag that'll display the poem in a straight line text</pre>

           <blockquote cite="http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/index.html">and the quote goes here abd the words will be indented by the browser</blockquote>
           <p>For SHORT quotation we use the q tag as in <q>action and reaction are equal and opposite</q> That is a quotation</p>
           <p> Let's try some abbreviation. The <abbr title="Federal Medical Centre">FMC</abbr> is located in the heart of Abeokuta Metropolis. & it is good to always add the title attribute to show the meaning</p>
           <p>to write address be it email, url, ph number, etc & it will be rendered in italics</p>
